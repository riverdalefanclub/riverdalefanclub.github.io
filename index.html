   <p> Cheryl is my favourite charecter. Yes she is crazy, and yes both her father and brother are dead but I've seen her from a different        perspective and I found that we really connect. </p>
   <p> Okay, yes I have mental problems and yes I burned down my house but who really cares? </p>
   <p>Just kidding :-) </p>


   <h2> Jughead Jones </h2>
   <p> Jughead Jones is such a badass. I love Cole Sprouse (aka Nea's bae) acting as him and I totally prefer him with black hair rather          than blonde. I'm melting at the scenes with him and Betty. They are so adorable together!!!! </p>

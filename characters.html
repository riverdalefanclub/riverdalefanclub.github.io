		<h1> These are all the characters you will learn or hear about on the show.</h1>

		<p> The Comentator (aka me!) is one of the most important charecters! Without me this show would be rubbish. Chaos everywhere! It is my job to keep our veiwers/readers uptodate on all the hot goss and info </p>
		<h2> The Gorgeous </h2>

		<p> The Gorgeous is the one that everyone wants to be friends with. They keep up the romantic tension with The Player and The Wild Card, but more about them later. </p>
		<h2> The Witness </h2>

		<p> The Witness is my number one source for all the hot goss. They have eyes and ears like an eagle so watch out or you might be next! </p>
